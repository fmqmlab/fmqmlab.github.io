This website hosts the web-based version of the PyDPE package developed by the Fahad Mahmood Group. This package plots a raw image file from our ARTOF detector, and shows the regions of the Brillouin zone where double photon emission might be observed. PyDPE-Web has no dependencies and can be run directly on your browser. Click on "QuickStart" to try it out!

If you would prefer to download the original PyDPE package locally, you can do so by heading to the "Additional Resources" section of our :doc:`Documentation <docs>`.
